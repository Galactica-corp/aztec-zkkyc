# ZK KYC by Galactica on Aztec

This repo provides a zero-knowledge solution for know-your-customer checks, in short ZK KYC.

The ZK KYC system enables users to prove compliance (e.g., Age ≥ 18, non-sanctioned status) and selectively disclose identity data to third parties (institutions/issuers) without revealing raw identity documents on-chain. It focuses on legally required KYC with guardians and uses Aztec/Noir for on-chain verification and private state management. Shamir’s Secret Sharing is used for conditional, threshold-based data disclosure.

A key feature are Guardians for KYC record keeping and auditing. This should satisfy regulatory requirements that mandate off-chain audit trails.

The repo also provides common components developed for this system, particularly the cryptographic primitives for secret sharing and KYC guardian integration.

This repo is based on the [Aztec starter](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-starter).

## Local Network



## Devnet

This repo connects to a locally running Aztec local network by default, but can be configured to connect to the devnet by specifying `AZTEC_ENV=devnet` in a `.env` file or by prefixing a command e.g. `AZTEC_ENV=devnet yarn deploy`.


## 🚀 **Getting Started**

Use **Node.js version 24.12.0 or newer**.

[Start your codespace from the codespace dropdown](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart).

Get the **local network, aztec-cli, and other tooling** with this command:

```bash
bash -i <(curl -s https://install.aztec.network)
```

Install the correct version of the toolkit with:

```bash
VERSION=4.0.0-devnet.2-patch.0 bash -i <(curl -sL https://install.aztec.network/4.0.0-devnet.2-patch.0)
aztec-up use 4.0.0-devnet.2-patch.0
```

### Environment Configuration

This project uses JSON configuration files to manage environment-specific settings:

- `config/local-network.json` - Configuration for local network development
- `config/devnet.json` - Configuration for devnet deployment

The system automatically loads the appropriate configuration file based on the `ENV` environment variable. If `ENV` is not set, it defaults to `local-network`.

The configuration files contain network URLs, timeouts, and environment-specific settings. You can modify these files to customize your development environment.

### Running on Local Network (Local Development)

Start the local network with:

```bash
aztec start --local-network
```

Run scripts and tests with default local network configuration:

```bash
yarn compile && yarn codegen  # Compile contract and generate TS
yarn deploy       # Deploy to local network
yarn test         # Run tests on local network
```

### Running on Devnet

All scripts support a `::devnet` suffix to automatically use devnet configuration:

```bash
yarn deploy::devnet              # Deploy to devnet
yarn test::devnet                # Run tests on devnet
yarn deploy-account::devnet      # Deploy account to devnet
yarn interaction-existing-contract::devnet  # Interact with devnet contracts
```

The `::devnet` suffix automatically sets `ENV=devnet`, loading configuration from `config/devnet.json`.

---

## 📦 **Install Packages**

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## 🏗 **Compile**

```bash
aztec compile
```

or

```bash
yarn compile
```

---

## 🔧 **Codegen**

Generate the **contract artifact JSON** and TypeScript interface:

```bash
yarn codegen
```

---

:warning: Tests and scripts set up and run the Private Execution Environment (PXE) and store PXE data in the `./store` directory. If you restart the local network, you will need to delete the `./store` directory to avoid errors.

## Transaction Profiling

**Make sure the local network is running before profiling.**

```bash
aztec start --local-network
```

Then run an example contract deployment profile with:

```bash
yarn profile
```

You can specify the bb binary path for faster native proving, e.g.

```bash
BB_BINARY_PATH="/home/user/.bb/bb" BB_WORKING_DIRECTORY="/tmp/bb" CRS_PATH="/tmp/bb" yarn profile
```

See the [demo-wallet for an example](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/demo-wallet/blob/main/app/scripts/copyBB.js) of how to fetch the appropriate bb binary (version and OS) in an application.

## 🧪 **Test**

**Make sure the local network is running before running tests.**

```bash
aztec start --local-network
```

Then test with:

```bash
yarn test
```

Testing will run the **TypeScript tests** defined in `index.test.ts` inside `./src/test/e2e`, as well as the [Aztec Testing eXecution Environment (TXE)](https://docs.aztec.network/developers/guides/smart_contracts/testing) tests defined in [`first.nr`](./src/test/first.nr) (imported in the contract file with `mod test;`).

Note: The Typescript tests spawn an instance of the local network to test against, and close it once the TS tests are complete.

---

## Scripts

You can find a handful of scripts in the `./scripts` folder.

- `./scripts/deploy_account.ts` is an example of how to deploy a schnorr account.
- `./scripts/deploy_contract.ts` is an example of how to deploy a contract.
- `./scripts/fees.ts` is an example of how to pay for a contract deployment using various fee payment methods.
- `./scripts/multiple_wallet.ts` is an example of how to deploy a contract from one wallet instance and interact with it from another.
- `./scripts/profile_deploy.ts` shows how to profile a transaction and print the results.
- `./scripts/interaction_existing_contract.ts` demonstrates how to interact with an already deployed pod racing contract, including creating games.
- `./scripts/get_block.ts` is an example of how to retrieve and display block information from the Aztec node.

### Utility Functions

The `./src/utils/` folder contains utility functions:

- `./src/utils/create_account_from_env.ts` provides functions to create Schnorr accounts from environment variables (SECRET, SIGNING_KEY, and SALT), useful for account management across different environments.
- `./src/utils/setup_wallet.ts` provides a function to set up and configure the TestWallet with proper configuration based on the environment.
- `./src/utils/deploy_account.ts` provides a function to deploy Schnorr accounts to the network with sponsored fee payment, including key generation and deployment verification.
- `./src/utils/sponsored_fpc.ts` provides functions to deploy and manage the SponsoredFPC (Fee Payment Contract) for handling sponsored transaction fees.
- `./config/config.ts` provides environment-aware configuration loading, automatically selecting the correct JSON config file based on the `ENV` variable.

## ❗ **Error Resolution**

:warning: Tests and scripts set up and run the Private Execution Environment (PXE) and store PXE data in the `./store` directory. If you restart the local network, you will need to delete the `./store` directory to avoid errors.

### 🔄 **Update Node.js and Noir Dependencies**

```bash
yarn update
```

### 🔄 **Update Contract**

Get the **contract code from the monorepo**. The script will look at the versions defined in `./Nargo.toml` and fetch that version of the code from the monorepo.

```bash
yarn update
```

You may need to update permissions with:

```bash
chmod +x .github/scripts/update_contract.sh
```
